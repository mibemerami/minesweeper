# minesweeper
One change to the known game is that I made a story mode with levels.  And the other big one is that I created randomly occurring 
events like: you get a bonus live.  Another important change, although very small, is that I switched the preconditions to end the 
game.  So now you have to mark every mine to win, not to click every mine-free tile. That has the impact that the 50/50-chances 
you that occur very often, now can be solved in the end by trying out. If there are not to many of them, because the number of 
tries you need raises exponentially. 
By the way, all graphics except the warning shields were created by me.
